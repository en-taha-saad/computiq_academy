This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets are inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. The course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two-thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.</p>",

We will demonstrate how to connect with the API and the web app. We&#39;ll learn how to layout the application and restrict certain sections of it to just authenticated users. All of this has been accomplished using well-known frameworks. We will be using the javascript and python programming languages, so some familiarity with these is necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis course is divided into two sections: an introduction to the framework in which we explain everything from the ground up and a hands-on portion in which you construct a complete application.

              "description": "<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Flutter, a Google-created framework, enables you to learn one language (Dart) and quickly create attractive native mobile applications. Flutter is an SDK that provides the tools to convert Dart code into native code as well as a comprehensive collection of pre-built and pre-styled UI components (referred to as widgets) that you can use to build your user interfaces.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Flutter is very popular, and critical Google applications utilize it, such as their Adwords app.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">This course will teach Flutter and Dart from the ground up; no previous knowledge of either is needed! You also don&#39;t need Android or iOS programming expertise since the entire point of Flutter is to master just one language.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Through this whole course, you will not only study Flutter in theory, but you will also create a complete, functional app. This app will include all of the fundamentals as well as advanced features.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">With Flutter, you can create code once and publish your applications to Apple AppStore and Google Play.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Using Google&#39;s Material Design, you can create attractive but completely configurable applications with little time and trim work. You may utilize Flutter&#39;s extensive widget suite to add standard UI components like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists, and more - or you can create your widgets - Flutter makes that easy as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">The following is a list of what is included in the course:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">A comprehensive introduction to Flutter, Dart, and the widget idea.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">An overview of the built-in widgets, as well as how to create your own.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Tips and Tricks for Debugging</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Tabbed page navigation, side drawers, and stack-based navigation</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Solutions for state management</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Taking care of and verifying user input</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Using native device capabilities</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Including lovely animations and page transitions</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">How to Get Your App Into App Stores</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">And there&#39;s more!</span></li>\r\n</ul>",
